# Algorithm Empirical Analysis
Hypothesis: 
For large values of n, the mathematically derived efficiency class of an algorithm accurately predicts the observed running time of an implementation of that algorithm.
The point of this project is to test this hypothesis by examining three algorithms:
1. Reformat date
2. Runtime encode
3. Longest frequent substring
